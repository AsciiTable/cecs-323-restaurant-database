/*
Trigger keeps users from allowing a sous chef to mentor more than one person at a time.
Tells the user that a sous chef is already mentoring someone if they try to insert a mentorID that is already in another row
/*
delimiter $$
create trigger oneMentee before insert on Mentorship
	for each row

2. When assigning sections per shift, this trigger makes sure that the right employee is working that shift

delimiter $$
